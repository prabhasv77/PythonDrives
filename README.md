Creating a Python project than helps us maneuver a vehicle inside a simulation. Enhancing the performance of Python model by providing analog Input through the program instead of Digital Input

# Datasets
The custom dataset is generated by driving the car from a first-person perspective view, which allowed the data to be trained on actual vehicle vision. This is done by turning on the hood camera in GTA-5. However, due to limited ram and free space in the System, the data is collected in grayscale images with a width of 160 pixels and a height of 120 pixels [160√ó120√óùüè]. Each image in the dataset has a respective steering angle and throttle. After driving the vehicle for a few hours in GTA-5, a dataset with 100,000 labeled images is collected. This dataset is then uploaded on Google Drive, which is mounted with GoogleColab for preprocessing and training.

The figure below shows the distribution of the steering angle and throttle of the collected dataset. As the car is driven straight for most of the part, most of the collected data lie about steering angle 0. Training a neural network on such a dataset would result in biased prediction to drive straight all the time, resulting in a poor performance by the network.
A threshold of 4000 is used to balance the steering data and throttle data to provide us with a more balanced data.
